The program features late-breaking news stories, national weather forecasts and sports highlights. Since 2013, it has been anchored by Anne Marie Green, who concurrently anchored the CBS late-night news program <i>Up to the Minute</i> until its cancellation in September 2015. The program is broadcast live at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time (airing in the early timeslot to accommodate CBS stations that start their local morning newscasts at 4:30 a.m.), and is transmitted in a continuous half-hour tape delayed loop until 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, when <i>CBS This Morning</i> begins in the Pacific Time Zone. The program usually airs as a lead-in to local morning newscasts on most CBS stations, although in the few markets where a morning newscast is not produced by the CBS station, it may air in a two- to three-hour loop immediately before the start of <i>This Morning</i>. The show is updated for any breaking news occurring before 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time, while stations throughout the network will join <i>CBS This Morning</i> in all time zones past that time at their local discretion or network orders for live coverage.</p>",

            "summary": "<p><b>America's Newsroom</b> is an American news/talk program on FOX News Channel, first airing on February 12, 2007. Derived from one of the network's slogans, the show features general news coverage, which is divided between two general categories, either originating from the National Desk or World Desk. The program also features a number of discussions on issues currently in the news, commonly inviting two separate people to come onto the program to give two separate view points, pulled together by questions asked by the hosts to help inform the viewers on the two points of views on the issue at hand.</p><p>Compared to the show's predecessor, FOX News Live, the show has added to FNL's general news coverage format by pressing a faster paced format in addition to featuring user-involved segment, Because You Asked, in which viewers are able to e-mail into the program to ask questions which were not asked, or possibly followed up, in the coverage of recent news stories or past news stories covered by the network. The Because You Asked segment was formerly seen during Fox Online, which was also hosted by Hemmer. Kelly's Court is another segment on the show that came with Megyn from Weekend Live, the segment looks at and discuss legal story.</p><p>The introduction of the news program is the continuation of a past press towards branded programming, which has been occurring since the introduction of Studio B in 2002. Also, the show presents a newer shift in the network's booking system that allows analysts and guests to select the hours which they wanted to appear. This contrasts with the past setup which asked personalities to appear during any of the hours of FOX News Live, limiting their availability to be on the network. On March 23, 2009, America's Newsroom launched in high definition and moved to the Studio J, the Election Night 2008 set used by the Fox News Channel. On February 1, 2010, Martha MacCallum, who was previously a co-anchor of The Live Desk, replaced Megyn Kelly as Hemmer's co-anchor on the program, while Kelly moved to America Live, which debuted on the same day in 1 ET time slot that was previously occupied by The Live Desk (which was cancelled three days earlier).</p>",

Sports Center anchor Mike Greenberg's Odd Couple relationship with former NFL player Mike Golic is the main focus on the show, and that illustrates their different views on sports. Mike Greenberg is portrayed as a typical nerd, who was not involved in athletic activites, and was constantly picked on by bullies. On the other side of the spectrum, Mike Golic is shown as the tough man, who isn't afraid to speak his mind, and isn't very intellectual. On most of the shows, the two argue over trivial things. One notable argument lasted for days, when Golic didn't clean out Greenberg's blender after using it (Greenberg is also portrayed as a neat freak.) Former professional athletes such as Mike Ditka and Mark Schlereth provide insight on the issues discussed.</p>",

Copeland has been strongly identified with preaching a prosperity and abundance message, commonly referred to as the prosperity gospel over the last 45 years. His Tarrant County, Texas-based Kenneth Copeland Ministries (KCM) advocates daily application of the \"Word of God\", meaning the Bible. KCM is a teaching ministry that specializes in biblical teaching that focuses on faith, love, healing, prosperity and restoration through diverse media, such as television, books, CD and DVD. KCM's motto is Jesus is Lord based upon Romans 10:9.</p><p>Historically, Copeland's ministry held a number of conventions across the United States which lasted anywhere from three to six days. The number of longer set conventions has waned in recent years, although KCM still holds an annual Believer's Convention in his hometown of Fort Worth during the week of July 4. Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, along with ministry friends including some family members, also preach at other conventions and conferences throughout the world. These events stream live on Copeland's website, kcm.org, as well as being shown on Christian television stations such as God TV and the Daystar Television Network. Portions of recorded conferences are shown Sundays. The Monday through Friday television broadcasts feature a Copeland family member, either alone or with another minister, discussing subjects from The Holy Bible. Most of these episodes are available on BVOV.tv!</p>",

Mike Greenberg is portrayed as a typical nerd, who was not involved in athletic activites, and was constantly picked on by bullies. On the other side of the spectrum, Mike Golic is shown as the tough man, who isn't afraid to speak his mind, and isn't very intellectual. On most of the shows, the two argue over trivial things. One notable argument lasted for days, when Golic didn't clean out Greenberg's blender after using it (Greenberg is also portrayed as a neat freak.) Former professional athletes such as Mike Ditka and Mark Schlereth provide insight on the issues discussed.</p>",

The show became a 2-hour program once again on February 9, 2015, as the running time is now from 1-3 p.m. ET, replacing <i>Street Signs</i>, which had its final episode on February 6, 2015.

Estefan is the niece of music mogul and producer Emilio Estefan, the husband of singer/songwriter Gloria Estefan. She is also a well- known Cuban model and show host for \"El Gordo y La Flaca.\"Molina's often irreverent attitude is balanced by Estefan's more demure manner. The show combines interviews with actors, musicians, and other celebrities with reports on their comings and goings.The show appears weekdays on the Spanish-language television network Univisión. It is filmed in the network's studios in Miami, Florida.</p><p>On December 15, 2006, as a send-off homage to <i>Rebelde</i>, <i>El Gordo y la Flaca</i> opened with the cast dressed in <i>Elite Way</i> school uniforms, with Lili Estefan as <i>Mía Colucci</i> and Raúl De Molina as <i>Giovanni Méndez</i>(complete in dyed orange/red hair), while doing a parody to the show's opening theme, <i>Rebelde</i>. It is notable that the homage was pre-recorded, as Raúl De Molina did not appear on the show on the day when<i>Rebelde</i> was shown for the final time in the United States.</p>",

            "summary": "<p><b>Mad Money</b> is an American finance television program hosted by Jim Cramer that began airing on CNBC on March 14, 2005. Its main focus is investment and speculation, particularly in publicly traded stocks. In a notable departure from the CNBC programming style prior to its arrival, <i>Mad Money</i> presents itself in an entertainment-style format rather than a news broadcasting one. Cramer defines \"mad money\" as the money one \"can use to invest in stocks ... not retirement money, which you want in 401K or an IRA, a savings account, bonds, or the most conservative of dividend-paying stocks.\" <i>Mad Money</i> replaced Dylan Ratigan's <i>Bullseye</i> for the 6 p.m. Eastern Time slot. On January 8, 2007, CNBC began airing reruns of the show at 11 p.m. Eastern Time, on Monday through Friday, and at 4 a.m. Eastern Time, on Saturdays.</p><p>In March 2012, the program became a part of what was formerly branded as <i>NBC All Night</i> in the nominal 3:07 a.m. ET/2:07 a.m. timeslot on weeknights, replacing week-delayed repeats of NBC's late night talk shows. In that form, only the video for the program was presented on a 16:9 screen with gray branded windowboxing andpillarboxing, with all enhanced business information, including the CNBC Ticker, removed. Because of the scheduling of local station's 4 a.m. or 4:30 a.m. newscasts to air<i>Early Today</i> depending on how a station schedules its overnight programming (even if it airs at the regular time in the Eastern and Pacific time zones for instance, seven minutes would have to be cut-off to fit in <i>Early Today</i> and a local newscast starting at 4:30 a.m.), it is subject to local pre-emption, including by NBC O&amp;O's.</p><p>On August 4, 2014, <i>Mad Money</i> was first broadcast in full 1080i HD, resulting in the removal of the sidebar that was seen on all of CNBC's other trading-day programming, until the sidebar itself was permanently removed altogether on October 13, 2014. The NBC presentation displays the native widescreen HD picture, albeit with the CNBC Ticker space still filled in with gray windowboxing.</p>",

Without italics, it is the name of the network's entertainment-news division. The newscast debuted on September 1, 1991, and primarily reports on celebrity news and gossip, along with previews of upcoming films and television shows, regular segments about all of those three subjects, and some news about the industry in general. The program first aired on September 1, 1991 and was originally hosted by Dagny Hultgreen. It features stories and gossip about celebrities as well as the film, music, and television industries. Since its launch, it has broadcast under a variety of formats, at one point even airing live during the mid-2000s (at this time, the show was named <i>E! News Live</i>). Starting in 2006, it was hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Giuliana Rancic. In April 2012, Seacrest was replaced by Jason Kennedy. Rancic temporarily left the show on maternity leave in August 2012 due to the birth of her first son (through a surrogate), leaving others to question if she would return. But Rancic reassured her fans by releasing a statement saying she had just signed a three-year deal with E! News and Fashion Police. During her leave, her anchoring duties were taken over by Catt Sadler. From 2006 until late 2010, <i>The Daily 10</i>, hosted by Sal Masekela, Catt Sadler, and at one point Debbie Matenopoulos, aired following <i>E! News</i>.</p><p>On September 21, 2010, E! announced the cancellation of <i>The Daily 10</i>. At this time, it was announced that <i>E! News</i> would be expanded to a one-hour format. The expansion became effective beginning on October 25, 2010, making it one of two entertainment news programs to have weekday editions that air in an hour-long format,HLN's <i>Showbiz Tonight</i> being the other. The series also debuted a new news set and began broadcasting in 16:9 high definition, downconverted to 4:3 letterbox (with pillarboxing for 4:3 SD video) on the channel's primary SD feed. Some talent previously featured on <i>The Daily 10</i>, including Catt Sadler, Clinton Sparks and Robbie Laughlin, were integrated into <i>E! News</i>, along with the addition of a segment called <i>The Daily 10 Take</i>, along with the inclusion of some former <i>Daily 10</i> segments.</p><p><i>E! News</i> does not produce episodes on major holidays, including Memorial Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas, with special pre-taped programs, the show's weekend edition or other E! programs airing instead, depending on where the holiday falls.</p>",

On October 3, 2011, after successful ratings and high popularity, Fox News announced that <i>The Five</i> would become the permanent 5 p.m. series, as the program had previously been announced to last only during the summer. <i>The Five </i>is currently the second-most-watched program in all of cable news in the United States, placing only behind <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>, also on the Fox News Channel. The program has occasionally been the number one rated cable news series in the key 25 to 54 viewing demographic.</p>",

Will romances be rekindled or will unresolved issues ruin these pairs? Between the bitter rivalries, jealous lovers, and demanding challenges, it'll take the ultimate couple to withstand the pressures of the game. And with a brand new, mid-season twist that will shock the cast like never before, the stakes have never been higher for these exes to work as teams.</p><p>The 25th season, Free Agents, forces players to compete on their own in a battle of perseverance and luck. The players will have no idea if they'll be competing in teams, pairs or as individuals until moments before each challenge begins. Winners are not only safe from elimination, but also have the power to choose one guy and one girl to send in.

They have seconds to plan and 30 minutes to cook an amazing course with the basket of mystery ingredients given to them moments before the clock starts ticking! And the pressure doesn't stop there. Once they've completed their dish, they've got to survive the Chopping Block where our three judges are waiting to be wowed and not shy about voicing their culinary criticisms! Our host, Ted Allen, leads this high-energy, high-pressure show that will have viewers rooting for a winner and cheering for the losers. <i>Chopped</i> is a game of passion, expertise and skill — and in the end, only one chef will survive the Chopping Block.

They break it down to Drury's THIRTEEN phases of the deer season....but it was the season that literally drove Drury Outdoors to the brink!

The series premiered on October 7, 1996, and the final episode aired on January 9, 2009. It was the precursor to the <i>Hannity </i>program, which airs in the same time slot. The show offered Hannity's conservative views and Colmes's liberal views incorporated into a current news story, or in conjunction with a featured guest.</p><p>In addition to politics, the show featured debate about soft news stories, such as the 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal or the death of Anna Nicole Smith, or one-on-one interviews with politicians, commonly with the host who most closely shared the guest's political ideology. The show's format resembled a former CNN show called <i>Crossfire</i>, which similarly had co-hosts on both the left and right.</p><p>Fox announced on November 24, 2008 that Alan Colmes would leave the show at the end of the year, but he remains a commentator on Fox News, runs the blog Liberaland, and makes occasional appearances on other programs like <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>, and Shovio.com's <i>TalkBackTV</i>. On December 11, it was announced that Hannity would take over the time slot alone with a new show simply titled <i>Hannity</i>, which would have a format closer to his weekend program <i>Hannity's America</i>. January 9, 2009 was the last airing of <i>Hannity &amp; Colmes</i>, with January 12 marking the beginning of the new <b>Hannity</b> program.</p>",

            "summary": "<p><b>E! News</b>, previously known as <i>E! News Daily</i> and <i>E! News Live</i>, is the flagship entertainment newscast of the E! network in the United States. Without italics, it is the name of the network's entertainment-news division. The newscast debuted on September 1, 1991, and primarily reports on celebrity news and gossip, along with previews of upcoming films and television shows, regular segments about all of those three subjects, and some news about the industry in general. The program first aired on September 1, 1991 and was originally hosted by Dagny Hultgreen. It features stories and gossip about celebrities as well as the film, music, and television industries. Since its launch, it has broadcast under a variety of formats, at one point even airing live during the mid-2000s (at this time, the show was named <i>E! News Live</i>). Starting in 2006, it was hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Giuliana Rancic. In April 2012, Seacrest was replaced by Jason Kennedy. Rancic temporarily left the show on maternity leave in August 2012 due to the birth of her first son (through a surrogate), leaving others to question if she would return. But Rancic reassured her fans by releasing a statement saying she had just signed a three-year deal with E! News and Fashion Police. During her leave, her anchoring duties were taken over by Catt Sadler. From 2006 until late 2010, <i>The Daily 10</i>, hosted by Sal Masekela, Catt Sadler, and at one point Debbie Matenopoulos, aired following <i>E! News</i>.</p><p>On September 21, 2010, E! announced the cancellation of <i>The Daily 10</i>. At this time, it was announced that <i>E! News</i> would be expanded to a one-hour format. The expansion became effective beginning on October 25, 2010, making it one of two entertainment news programs to have weekday editions that air in an hour-long format,HLN's <i>Showbiz Tonight</i> being the other. The series also debuted a new news set and began broadcasting in 16:9 high definition, downconverted to 4:3 letterbox (with pillarboxing for 4:3 SD video) on the channel's primary SD feed. Some talent previously featured on <i>The Daily 10</i>, including Catt Sadler, Clinton Sparks and Robbie Laughlin, were integrated into <i>E! News</i>, along with the addition of a segment called <i>The Daily 10 Take</i>, along with the inclusion of some former <i>Daily 10</i> segments.</p><p><i>E! News</i> does not produce episodes on major holidays, including Memorial Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas, with special pre-taped programs, the show's weekend edition or other E! programs airing instead, depending on where the holiday falls.</p>",

Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and lest known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed The Colbert Report, which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time. Good luck, Bill!</p>",

Mike Greenberg is portrayed as a typical nerd, who was not involved in athletic activites, and was constantly picked on by bullies. On the other side of the spectrum, Mike Golic is shown as the tough man, who isn't afraid to speak his mind, and isn't very intellectual. On most of the shows, the two argue over trivial things. One notable argument lasted for days, when Golic didn't clean out Greenberg's blender after using it (Greenberg is also portrayed as a neat freak.) Former professional athletes such as Mike Ditka and Mark Schlereth provide insight on the issues discussed.</p>",

It's co-anchored by former ABC News correspondent John Berman and CNN's chief business correspondent Christine Romans. The slogan for <b>Early Start </b>is \"News from A to Z\", but its viewers can expect to see the same formula that morning news shows have used for years, and that is a mix of hard news, entertainment segments and some surprises thrown in along the way. The program was originally co-anchored by Ashleigh Banfield and Zoraida Sambolin.</p>",
