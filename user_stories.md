# MVP
## BACKEND
* As developers, our team wants to store something in the database so that we hit the MVP for this project.
* As a busy professional, Amy doesn’t want to have to select her preferences from scratch every time she goes to the website. She wants to log in to her account and have the information already there.

## MODEL
* Jeremy wants to be able to only watch shows based on the genre.
* As a user who knows what shows she wants to watch, Grandma Mae wants to be able to filter a list of shows to only the ones that are relevant to her, specifically by category and day.
* As developers we want the data we retrieve to be pertinent to our end users needs without presenting extraneous filler information.
* As a user looking to discover new TV shows, Jeremy wants to see some descriptive information about each show that he is looking at.
* As developers, our team wants to limit the amount of calls we make to the API in order to keep our site moving quickly.
* Jeremy would only like to see a small list of shows because he’s not really looking to sift through too much data.

## VIEW

# Stretch:
_TODO - apply MVC structure when we get there_

* As a busy professional, Amy wants a calendar view that shows what tv shows are available to watch at what time so that she can find something to watch that works with her busy schedule.
* As a user who is interested in traveling Jeremy would like functionality both on the desktop and mobile (mobile view stretch)
* As a user I want to be able to use this tool cross platform on any of my devices regardless of the platform or OS.
* Jeremy would only like to see a specific number of shows on his list.
* As a user who already watches a lot of TV, Amy wants to be able to filter her calendar, as to not be distracted by other possible shows.
* Amy’s busy, so she wants the calendar to be persistent so she doesn’t need to filter it every time she views the site.
* Amy would like to keep a record of the shows she wants to watch in the app.
* Amy would like to integrate the app with her Google Calendar.
* As a TV addict, Amy takes her tv schedule very seriously and wants to have her calendar password protected.
* Jeremy wants some indication of what other users think of each show (likes).
* Jeremy would like to be able to discover new shows based on shows he already likes.
* As a user I want the ability to save my selections and set up alerts for the shows I’m interested in regardless of whether I am in my home town (local) or away visiting friends.
