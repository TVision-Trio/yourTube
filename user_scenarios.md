## Amy is a professional in a fast-paced environment, a software developer at a big tech company. She is often very busy and watches TV excessively to relax when she’s not putting in overtime. Wants to be able to set her schedule on little breaks between meetings and would like to watch something during her bus ride.

## Grandma May just sent her last of four grandchildren to college. One of her grandkids just gave her a computer to keep in touch, and she is finding out some wonderful things about it like calendars and e-mail. She has been a long time fan of some staple sitcoms and shows but with this move to a digital from analog, she is having a hard time figuring out when her shows are.

## Jeremy is a high school graduate who is about to go to college for linguistics after the summer. In the meantime he is trying to figure out what to do in his free time. He’d like to get into some new shows to watch over summer break. He would like to travel as well so he’s interested in having both a mobile and desktop experience.
