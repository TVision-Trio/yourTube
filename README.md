## Project Pitch
There are so many TV shows on the air right now, how can one person possibly find what to watch?

Enter yourTube: your very own TV calendar scheduler!

With our product, a user will select parameters that they want in a show and tell us their schedule. Then they will be presented with a calendar view for that week with each show that matches their parameters as well as the time. They will be free to select which ones they would like to watch.

The calendar is mobile, customizable, and designed with usability in mind.
